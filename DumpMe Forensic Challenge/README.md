It was really fun and interesting. I've consolidate on how volatility plugins works analyzing windows machines. Sadly these challenges made me realize how volatility3 is not on par with volatility. Not having to explicity wait the scan for Imageinfo and kdbgscan to get a profile for the next commands. It is faster but not that many commands are supported
As things remain the same, for memory analysis I'll run two instances of volatility: one volatility3 and one volatility 2.6 in parallel.

**Tool I've used**
* Volatility2.6
* Some basic linux commands :>
